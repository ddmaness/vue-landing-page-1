# [Vue Landing Page](http://vue-landing-page.surge.sh/)

## Description

In this project I attempt to iterate on [this](https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-landing-page/#) landing page using Vue, Gulp, and Sass in order to better understand these tools.

## What I learned

- The time investment in setting up Gulp is more than made up for by the increased productivity it allows

- Sass makes writting CSS way more enjoyable

- Vue has quite a bit in common with React, the change in syntax seems to be the only large hurdle

## How to run

Clone or download this repository and run `npm install` in the root of the project folder. After all dependencies are downloaded run `gulp` in the project folder to start the development server and enable automatic reloading on changes to Sass, JS, or html files.  `gulp dist` will optimize the images, and JS files for production.
